# landtree-test

Unfortunately I ran out of time and didn't complete the task. 
The core functionality is done although I have a failing test for the 'buildOwnershipTree' function. This funcition ended up being more complicated than I anticipated. Perhaps I should have stored more data in the landDb structure to reduce the look ups and therefore make the tree generation simpler.

To run the tests:

`npm i`

`npm test`
